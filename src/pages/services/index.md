heading: Digital Strategy

  Digital is revolutionizing consumer behavior, redefining the value chain
  across industries, and enabling organizations to become more customers
  centric. Many organizations have started to address how digital can be
  introduced into their businesses, but the majority have not yet defined and
  implemented a robust digital strategy.


  R2BK will work alongside our clients to build customer centric digital
  strategies that increase revenues and market share. These strategies permit us
  to create data-driven personas and a personalized customer experience.

  heading: Digital due diligence & portfolio assessment
  description: >
    Historically, the objective of due diligence has been to evaluate the risks
    related to a company acquisition or divesture(s), most commonly focused on
    financial, operational and legal aspects. Today, it has become essential to
    also evaluate the digital assets of a company, and the risks, costs and
    benefits to integrate a digital presence, its infrastructure and its related
    data.

    We work with private equity firms to perform due diligence and assess
    current and potential digital maturity and value of portfolio assets. We
    also work with investment funds to perform portfolio reviews, giving insight
    into overall digital performance and defining the key performance indicators
    to measure digital growth.

        companyâ€™s business, including marketing, product development, IT,
        customer service, and more. It refers to the collective changes in
        organization, technology and operations that allow a business to become
        more customer centric and agile, leveraging digital.

        As individual consumers, we are typically mature in our understanding of
        how to use digital channels to buy products and services. We know what
        is convenient, easy to use and reliable. For businesses, understanding
        how to best deliver this experience to customers and other businesses is
        much more challenging.

        Building a digital culture requires process and technology changes, but
        the new organization 1coach executives in their strategic vision, and we
        train teams so that they are ready to meet the digital and managerial
        challenges required to sustain their business growth.
